## Welcome!

This is the documentation for the alexich-css library of css utilities and Web Components.
Please note that this is a loose collection of css utility classes, UI component classes and
Web Components created for my very own use cases, which mainly emerged from building [alexi.ch](https://alexi.ch).

If you find this collection useful, fine, go ahead and use them as you like, maybe even [drop me an email](mailto:alex-css@alexi.ch) with a short note of how it was useful to you.

I have no intention to make this library a full-featured / complete library, nor will I implement
your use-cases / wishes.

**This documentation uses a lot of the framework itself, so have a look at the source code of this
page for inspiration.**
